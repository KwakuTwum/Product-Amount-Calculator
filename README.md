# Product-Amount-Calculator
This is a python program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased with a fixed tip. 

## Requirements
The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food.

It would then calculate the amounts of an 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax on the charge of the food and display each of these amounts.

It would add everything together and display the charge of the food plus tip and sales tax.

Based on this data, the program would generate script that meets the requirements. 

 
## Example
Below is an example execution of the program: 

# input

Charge for food = $50.00

# output

Tip = $9.00

Sales tax = $3.50

Grand total = $62.50
